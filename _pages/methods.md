We use a comprehensive suite of techniques to study structure, interactions, dynamics, and stability in biological and material systems. Our approach combines spectroscopy, scattering, thermal analysis, and advanced accessories to enable real-time, in situ measurements.

**Spectroscopy**
- Infrared (FTIR) – Transmission and ATR modes for chemical and structural analysis.
- Raman – Vibrational insights in hydrated and solid samples.
- UV–Visible & Fluorescence – Monitor chromophores, enzyme activity, and assembly kinetics.
- Circular Dichroism (CD) – Secondary structure in solution.
- Linear Dichroism (LD) – Orientation and alignment in films and fibers.
Accessories: ATR, rapid mixing (stopped-flow), titration setups, and electrochemical control.

**Scattering**
- Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) – Nanostructure and hierarchical organization.
- Small-Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) – Contrast variation for complex assemblies.
- Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) – Particle size and aggregation behavior in solution.

**Dynamics**
- Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) – Microstructural dynamics during gelation or assembly.
- Fluorescence lifetime
- Time-Resolved SAXS/SANS – Kinetic studies of structural evolution.

**Thermal Analysis**
- Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) – Thermal transitions, crystallization, and stability.
- Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF)

**Integrated & Hyphenated Approaches**

We combine spectroscopy and scattering with rapid mixing, tensile test, electrochemical control, and titration to monitor structural and chemical changes in real time under dynamic conditions.

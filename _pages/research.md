**Focus Area 1 — How Nature Builds Function Through Self-Assembly**
We ask a simple but profound question:
How does self-assembly in biological systems create structure and function?
By studying silk and related biopolymers, we uncover the principles that allow nature to build fibers with extraordinary properties. Understanding these principles enables us to control interfaces, paving the way for next-generation fiber-forming technologies and, as a frontier, bio-templated hybrid materials with advanced functionalities.

**Focus Area 2 — Structure–Function Coupling Under External Fields**
We investigate how external stimuli—electric fields, mechanical stress, and environmental changes—interact with molecular organization and interfaces. This research reveals new behaviors, including stimuli-responsive assembly, dynamic interfacial chemistry, energy transduction, and adaptive mechanics, thereby enabling multifunctional biomaterials that respond intelligently to their environment.

**Focus Area 3 — Predictive Design of Biomaterials**
We combine multimodal characterization with machine learning to predict assembly pathways and performance from sequence features, solvent conditions, and processing history. Our goal is to create design maps for adhesion, catalytic efficiency, and structural stability—accelerating discovery through data-driven insights.

**Focus Area 4 — Instrument Innovation for Mechanistic Insight**
To answer these questions, we design and build custom instruments, including small-angle scattering and spectroscopy instruments, electrochemical FTIR cells for bias-controlled spectroscopy, high-speed imaging platforms for reaction kinetics, automated sampling bridges for HPLC analytics, and integrated thermal–optical systems. These tools reveal hidden variables—hydration, charge, defect states—that govern assembly and catalysis.

# Welcome to the Soft and Complex Biomaterials Lab

## Why We Do What We Do
We ask a simple but powerful question:
*Can we use Nature to inspire and transform modern technology?*
Silk, with its remarkable strength, adaptability, and sustainability, is a compelling example of how biology can guide the design of advanced materials.

## How We Do It
We study biopolymers—like silk, elastomeric proteins, and enzymes—as model systems.
By combining optical spectroscopy, soft mechanics, and X-ray and neutron scattering, we uncover how these molecules assemble, adapt, and function across scales.
This molecular-level insight helps us design, modify, and control biopolymer-based materials with tailored properties.

## What We Do
Our research focuses on:
•	**Understanding** molecular structures and self-assembly in silks and other biopolymers
•	**Engineering** materials and scaffolds inspired by biological processes
•	**Developing** enzyme platforms and nanozymes for innovative biochemical applications
•	**Advancing** biofabrication and textile engineering through sustainable approaches
•	**Sharing** data, tools, and methods openly to accelerate progress in biomaterials science

## Our Impact
We aim to develop sustainable materials, improve healthcare solutions, and advance technologies that work in harmony with the environment.
By learning from nature’s most sophisticated materials, we help lay the foundation for a new generation of bio-inspired innovations.
